    "AddHubInstructions":"1. Set your first hub!\n\n    To set your first hub, simply tap the place marker button. A new potential marker will appear at your location and the voting tab will be opened. Place your first vote to finalize your new hub!\n",
    "VoteOnCurrentHub":"\n2. Vote on an existing hub\n\n    First tap on the hub where you'd like to vote. We want to make sure that our information is as accurate as possible so you can only vote on hubs where you are present!\n\n    If you're close enough to the hub, the voting tab will pop up with options to vote. Tell us whether this location is Lit! Or otherwise... If the tab opens and only shows the information button, you will simply have to move closer to the hub and you'll be able to vote. You get one vote per hub, however, your vote will only last for two hours to ensure we use only the most up to date information! After two hours make sure to vote again so others know if it's still Lit!\n\n    If your opinion changes before two hours are up thats fine! You can change your vote as many times as you like by reopening the voting tab and selecting a new option.\n"
